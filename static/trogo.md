### Impact of World War II on the Jewish Community in the Philippines

---

World War II brought significant changes to nations globally, including the Philippines. During the Japanese occupation from 1942 to 1945, the country underwent administrative restructuring and policy implementations that affected various communities, including the Jewish residents of the Philippines.

#### Restructuring of Administration and Imposed Levies:

- The Japanese administration in the Philippines merged with the Ministry of Intelligence at the war's outset, led by the Comptroller of Intelligence and Central Treasury. This restructuring significantly altered the Philippine administrative system.

- A German report shed light on the treatment of Jews during this period. Wealthier Jews, particularly those with substantial real estate and businesses, were mandated to surrender fifty percent of their property. Others paid a tax amounting to one-third of their entire property value. Failure to comply by the year's end risked the seizure and sale of their assets to fulfill the imposed tax obligations.

#### Jewish Population in the Philippines:

- During Japanese occupation, approximately 1,500 Jews resided in the Philippine Islands. Of these, 500 were long-term residents, while the remaining 1,000 were refugees who sought asylum there after fleeing the Nazi occupation.

#### Creation of a Ghetto and Accusations:

- Reports emerged of the Japanese establishing a ghetto for Philippine Jews in Manila, justifying it by accusing the Jews of aiding guerrilla movements. These allegations exacerbated tensions within the Jewish community, compounding their challenges resulting from imposed levies and administrative restructuring.
